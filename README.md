# PhotoPro - Modern Camera App

A powerful, feature-rich camera application built with React Native and Expo, designed for creators, photographers, and filmmakers.

## Composition Guides

The app provides professional composition guides that help photographers create well-balanced shots:

- **Golden Ratio**: Uses the 1:1.618 ratio found in nature for aesthetically pleasing shots

## Color Filters

Apply real-time color grading to your photos with these pre-defined filters:

- **Normal**: No filter applied
- **Warm**: Adds a subtle warm (orange/amber) tone to your images

# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
